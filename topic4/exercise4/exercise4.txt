the difference between svg and bitmap is when we use svg and we expand an image
it does not distort as it happens in the case of bitmaps, so svg is better, 
but when the image has irregular shapes like for example a landscape the same it's not good.
That another bad point to svg is we cant manipulate with javascripts.
